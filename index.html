    <h1>Hello (fallback)</h1>
    <p>This app was generated as a fallback because AIpipe failed. Brief: Create a simple portfolio website with an index.html file containing a basic layout, a README.md explaining the project, and an MIT license. The website should have a clean design with an About Me section.</p>
